# Readme

I'm trying not to scope creep too hard, but this Astro blog is using content collections api, wordpress and sanity headless cms and pulling from the api. I have separate pages to display each of the backends simply as a reference implementation for how to connect to each of them.

I would like to do the same thing with Keystone and AppWrite backends as well.

I want to experiment with the new Next.js features and Vercel's goodies around data like Redis KV, PG DB, and I don't think their S3 blob store is ready for open beta yet.

But other frameworks I'd like to get integrated are Next, Qwik, Remix, Redwood, Elyse, and Deno. I have a lot of different tutorials and things I'd like to try. I'm not sure how much I'll get to, but I'm going to try to do as much as I can.
